### Title:  Udacity - Data Science - Assignment 1 


### Introduction:
This is an assignment to do a data analytics blog, using airbnb data. The idea is you explore, analyse and visualize
the dataset in Jupyter notebooks, then upload the data to git hub, then write a blog about the data on medium.com

### Project Motivation:
This project aims to demonstrate skill in data wrangling, modeling and analysis. Furthermore it aims to demonstrate skill in using git/github and how to publish my analysis through a blog in an interesting and informative way.
I chose to use the AirBnb listings data for Manchester as it is a city I am familiar with and AirBnb is a platform growning in popularity, that hopefully the reader can relate to.

### Technology:
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git/github
- medium.com

### Repository contents:
- README.md - file containg a summary and useful information about the project.
- listings.csv - A CSV file containing the raw uncleaned listing data.
- Udacity_DSAss1.ipynb - Jupyter notebook project that contains python code, markdown text and graphical analysis.
